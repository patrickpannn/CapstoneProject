1/10/2021:
-Setup DB with Mongoose
-Tested DB

2/10/2021:
- Setup MongoDB with Robo T3

4/10/2021:
- Made skeletons for database models

6/10/2021:
- Made simple watchlistModel and User Model
- Discussed a means of defining a user order such that it expires in 24 hrs
- MongoDB has inbuilt functions to remove an entry after a certain amount of time

15/10/2021:
- Updated watchlistModel and added all key functionality

20/10/2021:
- Begun Order Model
- Implemented timeout for order model as well as order direction
- added order routes for buy and sell market order
- hooked up order model using api data from axios

25/10/2021:
- added order functionality for market orders
   - market orders will also store an executed order for later viewing
 
28/10/2021:
- added limit order routes for orders
- have buyLimitOrder, sellLimitOrder, and cancel Order
- removed timeout functionality of orders -> orders will exist forever

5/11/2021:
- Refactored orderController and added verifyPortfolio middleware
- portfolio now included in the request as an input for the orderController limit order related methods
- Added post save middleware for order model to handle executed orders -> create / delete stocks when an order (buy or sell order) is executed)


10/11/2021:
- Begun research on future sentiment analysis
    - following online tutorials and videos
    - implement using pytorch and using nytimes article search api
    
12/11/2021:
- Working on data pre-processing for RNN's
- Considering using "basic financials" api data from finnhub

13/11/2021:
- Working on past performance snowflake indicator
- Working on finding api which has data for global indices -> finnhub does not provide
- Selected and testing twelvedata api
- found activation function to map results from 0 to 1

14/11/2021:
- Working on future performance snowflake indicator
- Looked into another potential RNN implementation
- Researching interpolating methods of future price prediction rather than Sentiment Analysis based
   - Results are less than spectacular
   - Work needs to be done to predict long-term stock price behaviour -> currently extremely volatile
- Simpler implementation developed -> using EbitPerShare ratio
   - good indicator of stock health and future potential (too high a ratio and the stock is overvalues, too low and the stock is undervalued)


16/11/2021:
- Refactored codebase for snowflake analysis past and future methods
- looked into RNN method again, no headway made :(
